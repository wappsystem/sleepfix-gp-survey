                                    You are invited to take part in a research study for people with insomnia. In this study, we aim to treat your insomnia using a novel mobile application called SleepFix. The app program uses an evidence-based therapy called sleep retraining therapy which improves your sleep. The therapy works by reducing the time spent in bed awake and improving the total amount of time asleep. We are testing whether this app-based insomnia therapy is feasible in general practice by assessing how many individuals with insomnia download and use the app after being prescribed by their general practitioner.
                                    <br><br>Everyone who participants in this study will be given free access to the SleepFix therapy app on their smartphone. You will use the program for 3 weeks and have another 3 weeks access to the app if you feel that you want to engage in the therapy for longer. We will also provide you with a Fitbit to track your sleep. We will ask you to complete a series of online questionnaires at start of the study and after 6 weeks. 
                                    <br><br>This study is being funded by the Department of Health (Federal), Sydney Health Partners Medical Research Future Fund. This study is sponsored by the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research. The SleepFix app is supplied by Alertness CRC who do not have financial interests in this study.

                                    <br><br><b>Why have I been invited to participate in this study?</b>
                                    <br>This study may be suitable for you because you have been diagnosed with insomnia by your GP. To treat your insomnia, your GP will provide you with an invitation letter (like a prescription) for the SleepFix app which has been designed to improve your sleep. We are assessing whether individuals who have insomnia and visit their GPs will use the app after being prescribed by the GP.
                                    <br><br><b>What are the aims of this study?</b>
                                    <br>The study aims to determine if a therapy delivered using an app would be suitable to use in primary care. 
                                    <br><br><b>Do I have to participate?</b>
                                    <br>No, it is entirely up to you whether you wish to participate in the study.  If you do take part, you may withdraw at any time without having to give a reason. It is best to discuss the study with friends or family prior to consent. If you decide to terminate your participation in this study, please notify the SleepFix Research Team on 02 9114 0481 (Telephone) or at Woolcock.sleepfix@sydney.edu.au (Email). 
                                    <br><br><b>What does this study involve?</b>
                                    <br>This study will be delivered completely online, there are no face-to-face visits required. You have been given access to this website following your appointment with your GP who has prescribed for you the SleepFix mobile application. 
                                    <br><br>Please read the information below to better understand what the study involves.
                                    <br><br><b><i>i. Providing consent and completing questionnaires</i></b>
                                    <br>If you agree to participate, you will be asked to provide consent electronically (next page) and complete your first set of questionnaires (which will take approx. 15 minutes).  You will also be contacted by the research team to organise the delivery of a Fitbit device to track your sleep. If you already have a Fitbit device that measures sleep, please let the research team know. 
                                    <br><br><b><i>ii. Getting started</i></b>
                                    <br>Once you have completed your questionnaires, you will be assigned a unique access code which will be used at registration once you download the app. Before commencing therapy, we will ask you to watch a number of short instructional videos about SleepFix, how the treatment works and how to use the app. Following this, you will be provided with the instructions of how to download the SleepFix app.
                                    <br><br><b><i>iii. Using SleepFix</i></b>
                                    <br>Once you have installed SleepFix on your phone, you will need to set up the program. You will need to register an account and enter your access code to proceed. This involves a short series of questions about your current sleep pattern and what you think you can achieve during the therapy. You will be asked to use the app for 3 weeks, with a further 3 weeks of optional usage. However, it is up to you how much you use the app on a daily basis. It will only take approximately 2 minutes each day to complete the sleep diary entries in the SleepFix app, needed to check your progress. We will ask you to wear the Fitbit wristband for 3 weeks. You can continue using SleepFix following the 3 weeks of the treatment.
                                    <br><br><b><i>iv. Completing questionnaire at end of the study</i></b>
                                    <br>You will be reminded to complete your week 6 questionnaire via email and/or text. We will ask you to complete these online at week 6 (approx. 20 minutes).
                                    <br><br><b><i>v. Participating in an interview (following week 6)</i></b>
                                    <br>You will be invited to participate in a short one-on-one interview over the phone following completion of the study (approx. 10 minutes). You will be asked about your experience with the study and the mobile application.

                                    <br><br>Data will be stored on two platforms, one for the questionnaire data and another for the app-based data. Re-identifiable data on the app will be stored on a separate server to data that contains individually identifiable data from the questionnaire. 
                                    <br><br>The re-identifiable app data will be stored on a database located on Amazon Web Services in Sydney, NSW, Australia (Amazon Web Servers have 2 physical locations in Sydney).
                                    <br><br>The identifiable questionnaire data will be stored on a cloud-based platform developed and maintained by the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research (Research Tools TM). Data from individuals who have completed the initial screening questionnaires but were ineligible will be deleted.
                                    <br><br>Following completion of data collection, the non-idenitfiable data will be moved to the University of Sydney (NSW) Research data storage.  The data will be analysed at the Woolcock Institute, Sydney, NSW.  Data will not be used for future research purposes.
                                    <br><br>All data collected will be anonymised using a code number when you consent to participate in the study. The key linking your identity to your participant code will be stored electronically on a password-protected database on a secure server. This ensures your data will remain anonymous. Your data will only be used for the purposes of this study and will not be shared with anyone outside the research team. Access to your data will only be granted to the research personnel and data will be held for a minimum of 15 years, as per policy.
                                    <br><br><b>How will the results of the study be shared?</b>
                                    <br>The results will be published in academic journals and presented at conferences. Any data published in scientific journals will not be able to identify you.
